this bas file needs 4 things:

1. alookup2, which is my alookup function in exceleryroot/functions
2. getProductData, which is a fn that converts a range of data (from tacocat) and converts it to an array; alooku2p prefers an array
3. salesOrder data object (i have the class modules above)
4. removeFormatting() subrouting

so it feels like there are dependencies i guess
